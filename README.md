# Telco-Churn-Prediction

In this notebook we will predict if a customer left the company in the last month (churn).

We will be implementing: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Adaboost and Nearest Neighbors. Since our dataset has some imbalance, we need a more reliable metric than accuracy to measure our models.
